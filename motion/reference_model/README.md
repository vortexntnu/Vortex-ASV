## Reference model
An implementation of the bilinear transform (also called Tustin's method) for the continuous <-> discrete system transformation.
The reference model is imported in the LOS guidance system.

### ASV note
The poles and zeros here need to be altered for the ASV. It might also be a good idea to integrate this code directly with the LOS code, since this is what is done for the DP controller.
